"""
The retrain pipeline, shared by the CLI and the dashboard.

Both entry points call ``evaluate_and_fit`` so a model promoted from the Model tab
is the same object, judged by the same numbers, as one promoted from
``scripts/train_model.py``. Splitting the logic across the two would let the
reported metrics drift apart, which is the sort of divergence that quietly erodes
trust in the gate.
