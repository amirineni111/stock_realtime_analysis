"""
Judge a model on live, resolved trades rather than on its own training split.

A model's training metrics are a promise; this is the receipt. It reads the
probabilities the scanner actually logged at arm time, joins them to how those
trades really finished, and asks the only question that matters: would gating on
this probability have made more money than not gating at all?

Read the ``model_mode`` column before trusting any of it:

  shadow  the model scored every directional setup the rules proposed, so winners
          and losers are both represented and the numbers mean what they say.
  active  the model was gating, so only trades it *allowed* have outcomes. Its
          win rate here is measured on the sample it selected and says nothing
          about the trades it blocked. Never promote on the strength of these.

Rows armed before the mode was recorded carry a NULL and surface only under
``--mode any``. They were all produced by a gating model, so read them as ``active``.

Usage:
    python scripts/model_report.py
    python scripts/model_report.py --mode active     # inspect the censored rows
    python scripts/model_report.py --min-n 50
